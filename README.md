# ProTrack

ProTrack is my unique take on a Task Management System that allows users to set and delete tasks as they need. With each task that they are able to create, the user is presented with the following options:

Title: Add a title to their task

Description: Add any information as to what task they must complete 

Priority: Low, Medium, High (Based off how important the task is and how soon
they need to complete it by)

Status: To do, In Progress, Done

Due Date: Adding the date in which they need to complete the task by

Est. Time (min): Duration of the task
